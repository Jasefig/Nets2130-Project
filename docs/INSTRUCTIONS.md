# Crowdsourced Image Evolution Platform

Welcome to our collaborative crowdsourcing project! This system allows users to collectively evolve a seed image into more creative and “better” versions by typing prompts and voting on the results. Each day, the image with the highest votes becomes the new seed image for further transformations.

## How It Works

1. **View the Seed Image**:
   Every day, a seed image is displayed on the webpage as the starting point for creativity.

2. **Submit Prompts**:
   Users can type in up to 3 text prompts to suggest modifications or improvements to the image.

3. **Vote on the Best Image**:
   Once all contributions are submitted, users vote on the most improved or creative image.

4. **New Day, New Image**:
   At the end of the voting period, the image with the highest votes becomes the seed image for the next day.
